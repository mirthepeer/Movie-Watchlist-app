# Movie Search/Watchlist

A movie search and watchlist application built using JavaScript. This project is a demonstration of my skills as a developer and my ability to work with JavaScript and API's. The application allows users to search for movies using a movie database API and displays the results on the page. Users can also add movies to their watchlist, view the movies in their watchlist, and delete or add more movies to the list. The user interface is intuitive and easy to use, and the results are displayed in a visually pleasing format. I have used JavaScript to create the core functionality of the application and to interact with the movie database API. The project also uses HTML, CSS to create the user interface. This application is a great tool for movie enthusiasts to find and keep track of their favorite movies. Feel free to take a look and give me feedback.
